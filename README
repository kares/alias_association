AliasAssociation
================

A simple Rails plugin that adds alias_association to ActiveRecord classes.
Aliases all methods added by a reflection (e.g. has_many). The common use case
for such aliasing is during refactoring (keeping backward compatibility).


Install
=======

as a (plain-old) rails plugin :

    ruby script/plugin install git://github.com/kares/alias_association.git


Example
=======

    class Tree

      # f*ck we can't use the "Apple" name
      # SJ sad to sue to sh*t out of us !
      has_many :apples

      alias_association :oranges, :apples

    end

    # as all reflection methods are aliased, we might :
    tree.orange_ids = ...
    tree.oranges.add( ... )


Please note in case of reflections where the correspondent foreign key is an
attribute of the aliased class (e.g. belongs_to), the FK attribute is *not*
aliased (just to keep the magick on a sensual level) ! One might always alias
such FK attributes explicitly using an additional alias_attribute call.
